zee-zsh-theme
=============

Just another zsh theme. After browsing through all of http://zshthem.es/, I couldn't find perfect one, so here is my shot at it.

* Simple
* Minimalistic
* One-line prompt
* Python virtualenv support (shows up on the right)


Special thanks to dhruvasagar, amuse theme author (this theme is heavily based on amuse).
